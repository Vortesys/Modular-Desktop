![Modular Desktop banner](/misc/banner.png)

## What is Modular Desktop?
Modular Desktop is a fast, modular and powerful shell for Windows. The goal of Modular Desktop is to place provide a shell that can run alongside another to provide missing functionality, for example a sidebar for Explorer or a running programs list for Program Manager, or to run on its own as a quick and simple shell for those who desire to make their computer theirs.

## What does it run on?
Modular Desktop is designed to run on all x86 and AMD64 versions of Windows with a target of Windows 2000 and Windows XP x64 and above. Due to time constraints regarding testing, issues may appear in newer versions of Windows.

## Where do I get it?
The [releases page](/releases) will contain the latest version of Modular Desktop available for download, once builds are made available.

## How can I help?
Submitting [issues](/issues) and reporting or commenting on bugs that you find is a massive help. The next level is to contribute and create a [pull request](/pulls).

## What do I use to develop it?
Development currently happens with Visual Studio 2005. Support for other compilers and newer versions of Visual Studio may be added in the future.
